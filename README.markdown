## github-badges improved -- now works with IE[6,7,8]
I tried drnic's github-badges and found it crashed on all my IE[6,7,8]
browsers.  I rewrote github-badges and it works on IE as well as the
other browsers now.

### TODO
* reduce dependencies (jaml probably isn't so necessary, nor
underscore.js)
* pull out hard coded values, make easier for endusers to configure
